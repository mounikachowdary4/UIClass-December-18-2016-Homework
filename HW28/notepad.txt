diff between ui.router vs ngRoute
	ngRoute is used, route is configured with $routeProvider. However, when used with ui-router, route is configured with $stateProvider and $urlRouterProvider.

	ui-router allows for nested views and multiple named views. This is very useful with larger app where you may have pages that inherit from other sections.

	ngRoute is a module developed by the AngularJS team which was earlier part of the AngularJS core.

Multiple views
	Most applications can be broken up into regions. At a minimum, applications usually have a header, a main content area, and a footer.
	UI-Router supports multiple views and each can have its own corresponding Controller so that each of these regions can be encapsulated and reused throughout the application if needed.

Nested Views
	The common example of a nested view in applications is a master/detail or, more specifically, a list/detail page.
	Nested states allow you to separate controller logic for the various pieces of the application.

Nested routes
	Real app UIs are usually composed of components that are nested multiple levels deep. It is also very common that the segments of a URL corresponds to a certain structure of nested components.

Node.js
	Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of server tools and applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework, many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript.

Callback
	A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let's call this other function “otherFunction”) as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction.

Asynchronous
	JavaScript is asynchronous. This means we will not have any interruptions. If we are running event1 and event2 occurs, it will return to event2 only after event1 is completed. In other words when the event2 is read CPU will continue to execute rest of the statements in the program. Asynchronous programming will save time and executes fastly.
