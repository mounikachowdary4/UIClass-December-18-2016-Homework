1.Different types in CSS
  In CSS we have 3 types they are 
   -->Inline CSS
   -->Internal CSS
   -->External CSS
  Inline CSS--> In this we can apply the style to only one line at a time.
  Internal CSS--> Using this we can style the changes to the elements of same category at a time.
  External CSS--> Using this we can style the entire html document using the <link> element.

2.Cascading in CSS
  The cascade is a fundamental feature of CSS. 
  It is an algorithm defining how to combine properties values originating from different sources.

3.Why do we need to use CSS
  We use CSS to define styles for your documents, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. You can place your CSS in the <head> of a document with an embedded style sheet, or attach a separate file that defines your styles with an external style sheet.

4.Which type of CSS is a better practice
  Cascading Style Sheets have now become the standard way of adding the look and feel to a website. Virtually all the older HTML3 style commands have now been consigned to history and deprecated in HTML4 and most have been dropped completely in HTML5.

5.Selectors and use of selectors in CSS
  In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) we want to style. Examplesof some of the selectors are 
   .class
   #id
   element
   elementelement
   element+element
   attribute
   attribute=value
   attribute~=value
   attribute^=value
   attribute$=value
   ::active
   ::after
   ::before
   :checked
   :first-line
   :first-of-type .... etc
