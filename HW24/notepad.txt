Event handler
	An event handler is a callback routine that operates asynchronously and handles inputs received into a program. In this context, an event is some meaningful element of application information from an underlying development framework, usually from a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit or some kind of input routine.

Event delegation(javascript)
	Event delegation is, quite simply, using a single event handler to manage a particular type of event for the entire page. This isnâ€™t a new idea, but it is an important one to grasp for performance. 
Event delegation(jQuery)
	Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future.

Chaining in Jquery
	Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement.
