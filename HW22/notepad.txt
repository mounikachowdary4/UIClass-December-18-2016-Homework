DOM properties and methods
	DOM methods are the actions that are performed like adding or deleting HTML element
	DOM properties are the values that we can get or set like changing the content of the HTML element
	Example: document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Hello World"
	In the above example getElementById is method and innerHTML is a property.
	We can get the element by ID, classname, tagname
	we can also change the elements using innerHTML, attribute, .setattribute, .style.attribute ....

BOM(Browser Object Model)
	Gobal variables are the properties of window object
	Global function are the methods of the window object
	Example: window.document.getElementById("header"); is same as document.getElementById("header");

AJAX in Javascript
	AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
	AJAX stands for Asyncronous JavaScript And XML.
	It will allow web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with web servers behind the scenes.

jQuery
	jQuery makes it much easier for the javascript on the website.
	jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

what jQuery does that javascript doesnot 
	--jQuery doesn't need to do the same thing as Javascript, because it sits on top of Javascript, using Javascript.
	--For example, there's no jQuery function that lets you concatenate strings, but there doesn't need to be, since Javascript can already concatenate strings. There's no need for jQuery to re-implement that functionality.
	--You can't use jQuery with using JavaScript. For instance, jQuery can't replace basic JS like var i=4. Anytime you write jQuery, you're writing JavaScript. I think instead 'JavaScript' you should be saying 'native DOM functions', like document.createElement('div') vs $('<div></div>').

$ in jQuery versions
	--$ is pretty commonly used as a selector function in JS. In jQuery the $ function does much more than select things though. You can pass it a selector to get a collection of matching elements from the DOM.
	--if the page contains more than one JavaScript library, then $ may be used by another library, which can cause jQuery not to work.
